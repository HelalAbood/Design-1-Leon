## Hello, Guys!

This is my first Design - Leon! I've made this design as a template from the following site https://www.graphberry.com/item/leon-html-agency-template 
I converted the PDF file to HTML and CSS code. 
What's new for me: 
- Normalizing File in css
- Media Query on screens
- Containers on sections
- FontAwesome Icons
- Bootstrap v3


Next Update: 
- Retouching with js. 
- making a new background that moves via hover
- using a layout layer on pics by psudo elements
